# Learn-Python
Python exercises done as part of "Learn Python the Hard Way"

The purpose of this repo is to track all of the lessons and excercises I have been doing as part of [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). This has been a great, first resource for me to learn Python and I highly recommend it to anybody contemplating getting into or back into programming. Python is lot more friendly (i.e. a high level langauge) compared to Java (i.e. a low level language).
